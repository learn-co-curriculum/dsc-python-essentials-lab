    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you made it through the new content for the first section of the prework! This summative lab will help you review and practice everything you've learned in this section — \"putting it all together\" into an analysis with real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Recall the data types covered so far\n",
    " - Practice extracting information from a nested dataset\n",
    " - Practice generating insights with conditional logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task: Analyze Amazon Review Data\n",

    "#### 3. Review Summary\n",

    "##### a. Positive, Negative, or Neutral\n",
    "Print out information describing whether a review's rating is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
